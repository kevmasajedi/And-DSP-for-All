# Anti-Symmetry of Phase of Frequency Response üêáüï≥

When we study the frequency response of a system, we often use complex numbers to represent the response. A complex number has two components: a real part and an imaginary part. The real part represents the magnitude, while the imaginary part represents the phase.

Now, when we take the complex conjugate of a complex number, we simply change the sign of the imaginary part. For example, the complex conjugate of 3 + 4i is 3 - 4i. This is because the complex conjugate represents the reflection of the complex number about the real axis. The real part remains unchanged, while the imaginary part changes sign.

Similarly, the anti-symmetry of the phase of the frequency response about œÄ is due to the fact that the phase of a complex function changes sign under complex conjugation. This means that if we reflect the complex function about the real axis (which is equivalent to shifting the frequency axis by œÄ), we obtain the complex conjugate of the original function with the sign of the imaginary part flipped, which corresponds to the negative of the original phase.

So, shifting the frequency axis by œÄ is essentially the same as applying complex conjugation to the complex function that represents the frequency response. This is why the symmetry and anti-symmetry properties of the frequency response are closely related to the properties of complex conjugation.
