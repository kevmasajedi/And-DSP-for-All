# Convolution ✳️
It's not a good idea to start explaining convolution by refering to its mathematical definition. It's unfamiliar and intimidating. However, when you think about the concept of convolution, in more concrete examples, it is arguably intuitive.

Essentially, when you convolve two functions, you:
1. Mirror one of the functions, about the _y-axis_.
2. You slide one function over the other, and multiply them point-by-point.

To have an intuitive grasp, take a look at this gif:
