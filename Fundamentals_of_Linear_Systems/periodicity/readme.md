# Periodicity of Frequency Response üêáüï≥
When we talk about the frequency response of a system, we're really talking about how the system responds to different frequencies of input signals. Now, one way to characterize a signal is by its frequency content, which can be decomposed into sinusoidal components of different frequencies.

As it turns out, sinusoidal signals are periodic, meaning they repeat themselves after a certain amount of time. The period of a sinusoidal signal is related to its frequency - the higher the frequency, the shorter the period.

So, when we look at the frequency response of a system, we're really looking at how the system responds to these sinusoidal signals of different frequencies. And because these sinusoidal signals are periodic, the response of the system to a given frequency will be the same as its response to that frequency plus any multiple of the period of the sinusoid.

In other words, if we shift the frequency axis by a multiple of the period of the sinusoid (which is 2œÄ), we'll get the same response. This is the periodicity of the frequency response that we observe.
